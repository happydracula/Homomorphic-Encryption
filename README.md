# Homomorphic Machine Learning

Native Python implementation of the BFV and CKKS homomorphic encryption schemes and demonstration of homomorphic machine learning inference in linear and logistic regression.

**Instructions:**

Run: `pip install -e .` in the root directory to set up the project.

To view a demonstration of BFV homomorphic operations, run: `python -m BFV_Scheme.bfv_example`

To view a demonstration of CKKS homomorphic operations, run: `python -m CKKS_Scheme.ckks_example`

The ML_examples folder contains python notebooks implementing custom models for homomorphic inference  on encrypted data.
